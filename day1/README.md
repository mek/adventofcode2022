# AOC 2022 - Day 1
onetrueawk https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk

We don't have to worry about WHICH elves, only that how much 
they collect. So, I didn't. 

Notes:
 * The sort function is not included for arrays with one true awk. So I wrote a very simple and slow sort, which is probably a copy of something I read or seen in in somebody else's code. 
 * Yea, this isn't pretty but works. 

Usage:
  ./day1 num_of_top_counts input_file

```
$ ./day1.awk 1 input 
70369
$ ./day1.awk 2 input 
203002
```
